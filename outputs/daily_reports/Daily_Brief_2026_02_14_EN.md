### **US Inflation Cools, Fueling Fed Rate Cut Hopes**
U.S. January Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% year-over-year, with core CPI up 2.5% year-over-year and 0.3% month-over-month, largely meeting or slightly underperforming expectations and indicating a continued cooling trend. This deceleration is primarily attributed to easing energy prices and stabilized supply chains, leading to predictions that the Fed's 2% inflation target could be met by mid-year. Traders have increased their bets to a 50% probability for three Fed rate cuts this year, suggesting an amplified expectation for future monetary policy easing.

### **US Treasury Yields Decline on Dovish Fed Outlook**
U.S. Treasury yields fell following the softer-than-expected January CPI report, with a notable decline in short-term notes, as the 2-year Treasury yield briefly dipped below 3.4%. This movement reflects increased market expectations for accelerated Federal Reserve rate cuts, while China's ongoing reduction in its U.S. Treasury holdings represents a separate, long-term demand challenge. Treasury yield volatility is expected to persist based on the Fed's future monetary policy trajectory, with a potential for continued strength in the short end of the curve.

### **US-Taiwan Trade Deal Impacts Semiconductor Landscape**
The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade agreement, reducing mutual tariffs from 20% to 15% and potentially offering duty-free benefits contingent on increased semiconductor production within the U.S. This pact aims to incentivize Taiwanese investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and bolster economic ties between the two nations. The agreement could intensify U.S. pressure on other semiconductor-producing countries, such as South Korea, to increase their own investments in U.S. facilities, thereby accelerating global semiconductor supply chain restructuring.
