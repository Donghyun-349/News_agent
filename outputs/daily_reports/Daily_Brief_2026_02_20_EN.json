        "text": "U.S. pending home sales declined by 0.8% month-over-month in January, missing forecasts, even as mortgage rates reached their lowest point in over three years. This contraction in sales activity suggests a persistent stagnation in purchasing, likely influenced by tight housing supply and potential buyer hesitation despite improved borrowing costs. The market is thus anticipated to continue facing headwinds from inventory shortages and cautious buyer sentiment, potentially limiting transaction growth even with further rate reductions.",
