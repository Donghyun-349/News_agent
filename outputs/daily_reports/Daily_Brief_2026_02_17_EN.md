### 📉 Global Outlook
### **Fed Considers Easing Mortgage Regulations**
Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman announced the consideration of easing bank regulations concerning mortgage servicing assets (MSRs) to encourage banks to expand their mortgage lending activities. This initiative aims to entice banks back into the mortgage market by removing the requirement for MSRs to be deducted from regulatory capital, while maintaining a 250% risk weighting. Such changes are expected to inject liquidity into the housing market, foster greater bank participation in mortgage business, and positively impact the overall housing finance landscape.

### **UBS Forecasts Two Fed Rate Cuts This Year**
UBS has revised its outlook, now expecting the Federal Reserve to implement two interest rate cuts later this year. This revised forecast likely incorporates recent economic indicators and statements from Fed officials, reflecting a potential moderation in the U.S. economy and an easing of inflationary pressures. Fed rate cuts could serve as a positive market signal, enhancing investor sentiment towards equities and stimulating economic activity by reducing borrowing costs.

### **Japan's Economic Surge and 'Buy Japan' Trend**
Japan recently recorded a 1.1% growth rate, surpassing South Korea after 27 years, and following the House of Representatives election, a 'Buy Japan' trade emerged with a strengthening Yen and a 4.96% surge in the Nikkei index. This phenomenon results from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's landslide electoral victory combined with an unexpected Yen appreciation, breaking the inverse correlation where the Japanese stock market previously relied on a weaker Yen, thereby highlighting the investment appeal of Japanese assets. If Japan's robust economic growth and the 'Buy Japan' trend persist, further foreign capital inflows into Japanese equity and bond markets are anticipated, which would enhance the overall vitality of Japan's financial markets.



### 🚀 Market (Stock/Indices)
### **U.S. Major Indices Face Downward Pressure Amid Caution**
Nasdaq futures saw a decline, and the S&P 500 struggled to breach the 7,000-point threshold, indicating overall downward pressure on major indices. This cautious investor sentiment is attributed to anticipation of key economic data releases, leading to a prevalent wait-and-see approach. Consequently, the market is facing significant resistance levels, suggesting potential for increased volatility in the near term.

### **Gold Exceeds $5,000, Gains Limited by Thin Trade**
Gold prices surpassed $5,000, though holiday-thinned trading limited further gains.

### **Shiba Inu Rebounds 25% from Lows**
Shiba Inu successfully rebounded, rising 25% from its lowest point. This resurgence likely stems from renewed speculative interest in meme coins or specific community-driven events. While signaling a potential short-term price recovery, the long-term sustainability of such gains in meme coins remains highly speculative.


### **Roubini Warns of Crypto's End Amidst Bitcoin Recovery**
Nouriel Roubini, renowned for predicting the 2008 Lehman crisis, has warned of the 'end of cryptocurrency,' even as Bitcoin recovered to 100 million KRW. His skepticism reflects concerns over the inherent lack of intrinsic value, speculative nature, and regulatory risks within the digital asset space. This high-profile warning could influence institutional investor sentiment and future regulatory actions concerning the crypto market.
