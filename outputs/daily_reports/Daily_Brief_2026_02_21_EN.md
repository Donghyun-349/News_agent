### **US Inflation Heats Up, Fed Rate Cut Bets Fade**
US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation for December exceeded expectations, yet remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, prompting Atlanta and Dallas Fed Presidents to voice concerns about the strong economy and persistent inflation. This data and hawkish commentary have significantly diminished expectations for early Fed rate cuts, leading the dollar to its best weekly performance since October. Consequently, these inflationary pressures and the Fed's cautious stance are expected to push back market expectations for interest rate reductions and exert upward pressure on bond yields.

### **Supreme Court Strikes Down Trump-Era Tariffs**
The US Supreme Court ruled against former President Donald Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" imposed without Congressional approval, a decision that could trigger $100 billion to $175 billion in refunds. While the Court found that the President exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the Treasury indicated it would utilize other trade authorities, such as Sections 232 and 301. This ruling could fundamentally undermine Trump's trade strategies, leading to immediate declines in Treasury yields and a weaker dollar, though future trade policy uncertainty persists due to the potential for alternative measures.

### **Escalating Geopolitical Tensions Between US and Iran**
The United States has amassed significant military assets, including two aircraft carriers and dozens of fighter jets, near Iran, sharply escalating military tensions in the Middle East. This deployment coincides with reports that former President Trump is considering limited strikes to coerce Iran into a nuclear deal, suggesting a growing risk of military confrontation in the region. Such geopolitical instability is poised to heighten concerns over global energy supply chains and increase volatility across international oil and financial markets.

### **Oil Prices Respond to Mideast Unrest and Supply Shifts**
International oil prices surged to a six-month high, with Brent crude surpassing $71 per barrel, driven by escalating US-Iran geopolitical tensions and mounting concerns over potential Strait of Hormuz closures. Concurrently, global supply dynamics are shifting, with Spain's Repsol planning to triple Venezuelan oil output after securing a US permit, and a $90 billion Russian oil smuggling ring being exposed. While geopolitical premiums and supply uncertainties will maintain oil price volatility, potential increases in supply could partially offset upward price pressures.

### **US-China Military Standoff Near South Korea**

Such military encounters can exacerbate regional geopolitical tensions, potentially negatively influencing investor sentiment towards stability in key Asian markets.

### 🚀 Market (Stock/Indices)
### **Etsy Divests Depop, Reshapes Portfolio**
Etsy sold its second-hand clothing platform Depop to eBay for $1.2 billion, realizing a significant loss from its 2021 acquisition price of $1.62 billion. This strategic move reflects Etsy's pivot to focus on core business and portfolio re-evaluation as e-commerce growth slows post-pandemic. The divestiture is expected to enhance Etsy's financial flexibility and strengthen eBay's position in the pre-owned fashion market.


### **Walmart Shares Dip on Muted Guidance**
Walmart reported better-than-expected Q4 EPS and revenue, driven by strong U.S. comparable store sales and e-commerce growth, yet its stock fell 3% after hours. The decline was triggered by the company's full-year guidance falling short of analyst estimates, signaling investor concerns about future profitability and growth momentum. This suggests that while Walmart remains a retail powerhouse, its short-term stock performance may be impacted by cautious outlooks.


### **Amazon Overtakes Walmart in Annual Revenue**
Amazon has for the first time surpassed Walmart as the world's leading company by annual revenue. This milestone underscores Amazon's relentless expansion across e-commerce, cloud computing (AWS), and digital advertising, enabling it to achieve unprecedented scale. Amazon's revenue leadership solidifies its dominant position in the global economy and marks a significant shift from traditional retail to diversified digital and tech services.


### **Bitcoin Futures Hint at Slowing Price Surge**
Bitcoin futures data suggests a potential moderation in the cryptocurrency's recent rapid price appreciation. This indication from the derivatives market often reflects cautious institutional investor sentiment and hedging activities following a substantial rally. The futures market implies that extreme bullish momentum may temper, potentially leading to a more stable or consolidative phase for Bitcoin.

### **Eric Trump Predicts $1M Bitcoin**
Eric Trump reiterated his strong conviction that Bitcoin's price will ultimately reach $1 million, citing its historical average annual growth of approximately 70% over the past decade. This optimistic long-term outlook is fueled by beliefs in Bitcoin's increasing adoption, inherent scarcity, and potential as a store of value. Such high-profile endorsements contribute to a positive long-term sentiment among investors, fostering bullish expectations despite short-term volatility.


### **'Bitcoin Death Cross' Fears Resurface**
Speculation about a "Bitcoin death cross" has re-emerged, causing a surge in Google searches for "0 dollar fall" amidst heightened market fear. A death cross, a technical analysis pattern, often signals potential downward price momentum, triggering panic among less experienced investors. While technical indicators can influence sentiment, Bitcoin's fundamental drivers and long-term investor conviction may mitigate severe downside, though short-term volatility could persist due to fear-driven selling.


### **Global Equity Funds Attract Record Inflows on AI Optimism**
Global equity funds recorded their largest inflows in five weeks, with U.S. equity funds leading this significant trend. This surge in investment is largely attributed to an easing of concerns surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sustained positive market sentiment towards the technology sector. The consistent capital inflow suggests renewed investor confidence in the equity market, particularly in growth-oriented segments, potentially driving further market gains.

### **Precious Metals Climb Following Tariff Ruling**
Precious metals settled higher after a recent tariff ruling, signaling a positive market reaction. The tariff decision likely introduced elements of economic uncertainty or currency fluctuation, traditionally boosting demand for safe-haven assets such as gold and silver. This upward movement suggests that geopolitical and trade policy developments continue to be significant drivers for precious metal prices, warranting close monitoring.

### **Newmont CEO Prioritizes Margins Amidst Record Gold Prices**
Newmont's CEO emphasized prioritizing margins over being "starry-eyed" about record gold prices, signaling a strong focus on operational efficiency. This strategic stance reflects a disciplined approach to leveraging high gold prices, aiming to maximize profitability through cost control and prudent capital allocation rather than aggressive expansion. The emphasis on margin protection indicates that major gold producers may not significantly increase supply despite elevated prices, potentially supporting sustained high price levels in the long term.

### **NVIDIA's Strategic Portfolio Adjustments**
NVIDIA has divested its entire stake in Arm, a UK-based semiconductor design company it once sought to acquire, while reports suggest its potential investment in OpenAI could be adjusted downwards from an initially speculated $100 billion to $30 billion. The Arm divestiture follows a failed acquisition attempt in 2022 due to regulatory hurdles, signaling a strategic refocus, while the OpenAI investment recalibration reflects ongoing fundraising complexities and market dynamics. These portfolio adjustments underscore NVIDIA's intent to concentrate resources on core AI technology development and strategic partnerships, solidifying its market leadership and standard-setting within the AI ecosystem.

### **China Reroutes Drone Exports to Russia via Thailand to Evade Sanctions**
China is reportedly utilizing a new route through Thailand to export drones to Russia, a move interpreted as an attempt to circumvent Western sanctions and highlighting ongoing military cooperation. This redirection of drone exports through a third country became necessary as Western nations intensified sanctions against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, prompting China to find alternative supply channels. This circumvention strategy is likely to escalate geopolitical tensions and could provoke further sanctions from Western powers against China, introducing increased uncertainty for global trade dynamics and specific technology companies.
