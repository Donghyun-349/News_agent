### 📉 Global Outlook
### **U.S. Inflation Eases, Treasury Yields React**
The U.S. January Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% month-over-month, slightly below the 0.3% market consensus, leading to a broad rally in U.S. Treasury prices, particularly for shorter-term bonds. This moderating inflation trend prompted the White House to advocate for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts to further accelerate economic growth. Easing inflationary pressures are expected to reinforce market expectations for earlier Fed rate cuts, potentially boosting asset markets, while upcoming Q4 GDP and PCE data will provide further directional clues.




### **Accelerated Discussions on Critical Mineral Supply Chain Restructuring**
The U.S. convened a virtual meeting with trade ministers from key nations, including South Korea, Canada, and the EU, to discuss strategies for stabilizing critical mineral supply chains. Hosted by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), this marks the third high-level discussion following prior meetings among finance and foreign ministers. Such multilateral efforts are expected to accelerate the diversification and reshoring of critical mineral production, significantly impacting global trade flows and strategic alliances amidst rising geopolitical tensions.


### **U.S. to Sell Advanced Patriot Missiles to Taiwan**
The United States is proceeding with a substantial sale of advanced Patriot missile systems to Taiwan. This move aims to bolster Taiwan's defensive capabilities against the perceived threat of Chinese ballistic missiles, aligning with the U.S.'s commitment to regional security. The arms sale is likely to escalate geopolitical tensions with China, potentially impacting cross-strait relations and the broader stability of the Indo-Pacific region.


### **Yen Carry Trade Warned as 'Ticking Time Bomb'**
An analyst has characterized the yen carry trade as a "ticking time bomb," signaling significant potential risks. This warning stems from the prospect of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) shifting away from its ultra-loose monetary policy, which could reverse interest rate differentials and trigger a rapid unwinding of carry trade positions. A large-scale unwinding of yen carry trades could induce substantial volatility in global currency and fixed-income markets, with the impact amplified by the BOJ's pace of policy normalization.

### **Bank of America Flags Downside Risks for U.S. Dollar**
Bank of America (BofA) has identified downside risks for the U.S. dollar, citing growing concerns over affordability within the U.S. economy.

A depreciating dollar could influence global trade dynamics, U.S. corporate earnings, and commodity prices, potentially redirecting capital flows towards other major currencies or safe havens.

### **U.S. Defense Department Briefly Lists, Then Removes Alibaba and BYD from Military Support List**
The U.S. Department of Defense temporarily added Chinese tech giants Alibaba and BYD to its '1260H' list of alleged Chinese military support companies, only to swiftly withdraw them.

### **U.S. Federal Reserve Advances Classification of Crypto as 'Independent Asset Class'**
The U.S. Federal Reserve is reportedly advancing efforts to classify cryptocurrencies such as XRP and Bitcoin as independent asset classes. This initiative reflects a growing recognition of digital assets' unique characteristics and their expanding presence within the broader financial ecosystem, prompting regulators to establish clearer frameworks. Such a classification could accelerate the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems, potentially leading to increased institutional adoption and more defined regulatory oversight.


### **German Financial Sector Eyes XRP as Key to Next-Gen Financial System**
The German financial sector reportedly views XRP as a potential core component of future financial systems, with some analysts forecasting a price breakthrough to $9. This positive sentiment stems from XRP's proven utility in cross-border payments and its potential to streamline interbank transactions, positioning it as a crucial digital asset for financial infrastructure. Favorable institutional views and adoption in major economies like Germany could significantly boost XRP's credibility and demand, influencing its market value and broader financial integration.


### **Tesla's U.S. Sales Estimated Down 17% in January Amid Subsidy End**
Tesla's U.S. sales are estimated to have declined by 17% in January, marking a significant downturn for the electric vehicle giant. This sales slump is primarily attributed to the recent conclusion of federal tax credits, which previously incentivized consumer purchases, leading to a rapid cooling of demand. A sustained reduction in sales performance could impact Tesla's revenue projections and market share in the competitive EV sector, potentially prompting price adjustments or new incentive programs.


### 🤖 Tech (AI/Semiconductors)
### **TSMC Boosts Investment in AI Semiconductor Production**
TSMC has approved a substantial $45 billion investment through Q1 2026, aiming to significantly enhance its production capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors.
This strategic move is a direct response to the escalating demand and rapid technological advancements in AI, solidifying TSMC's dominance in the global AI chip market.
The massive capital injection is expected to alleviate potential AI chip supply shortages and provide a positive impetus for related equipment and materials industries.


### **Intensified AI Competition in China Ahead of Lunar New Year**
Major Chinese tech giants, including ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, are engaged in fierce competition to promote their AI services and attract users during the Lunar New Year holiday.
This aggressive marketing push reflects a broader strategic effort to secure market share and leadership within China's rapidly growing AI sector, mirroring the global rivalry among U.S. AI firms.
The heightened competition is likely to offer consumers a wider range of AI services and accelerate the commercialization of AI technology in China, though it may lead to short-term price wars.



### **SpaceX Explores Dual-Class Shares Ahead of Potential IPO**
SpaceX, led by Elon Musk, is reportedly considering a dual-class share structure as it moves towards a potential initial public offering (IPO).
This move is interpreted as an effort to strengthen Musk's control over the company and establish a stable governance framework to pursue its long-term, ambitious space exploration vision.
While the adoption of dual-class shares could face resistance from some investors, a successful IPO would likely amplify investor interest across the broader space industry.


### **CATL Nears Commercialization of Sodium-Ion Battery EVs**
CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer, has successfully launched production-ready electric vehicles equipped with sodium-ion batteries in collaboration with Changan Automobile, achieving a driving range of 500-600 km.
Sodium-ion batteries are emerging as a cost-effective alternative to lithium-ion, offering advantages in affordability and superior performance in cold climates, potentially bolstering China's energy independence.
The commercialization of this technology could significantly lower EV prices, accelerate mass adoption, and particularly boost EV market growth in regions with harsh winter conditions.


### **AI's Broad Economic Ripple Effects Predicted by UBS**
UBS warns that the disruptive impact of artificial intelligence (AI) is set to extend beyond equity markets into the bond market, potentially leading to significant defaults in corporate loans to private equity-backed software and data service companies.
This assessment stems from AI's fundamental reshaping of traditional industry models and competitive advantages, placing direct financial pressure on companies vulnerable to AI-driven disruption.
The AI-induced industrial transformation will recalibrate risk profiles across financial markets, necessitating that investors analyze not only AI beneficiaries but also sectors facing challenges from the technology.


### 🌏 Region (China/Eurozone)
### **China Real Estate Market Outlook**
China's real estate sector is reportedly beginning to bottom out, supported by recent policy interventions. This stabilization comes as authorities implement various supportive measures aimed at boosting confidence and stimulating demand. Despite these positive signs, significant oversupply remains a critical challenge, suggesting that a complete market recovery will be a prolonged process.
