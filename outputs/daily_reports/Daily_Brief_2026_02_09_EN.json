        "text": "The U.S. housing market is showing signs of stabilization and potential revival, driven by mortgage rates approaching their lowest levels in three years and maintaining recent flatness. This shift follows a post-boom adjustment, allowing for price stabilization in some metropolitan areas while other regions continue to see price appreciation despite tighter inventory. The outlook suggests that declining rates will progressively boost buyer activity, leading to a more balanced market dynamic, though persistent low inventory will likely continue to exert upward pressure on prices and pose affordability challenges.",
