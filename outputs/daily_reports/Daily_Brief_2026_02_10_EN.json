This dual focus highlights Tesla's strategic efforts to diversify its product portfolio beyond passenger vehicles and secure broader regulatory acceptance for its FSD technology, particularly with new UN regulations potentially enabling FSD deployment in European and Asian markets. The commercialization of the Semi truck is poised to disrupt the logistics sector, while FSD advancements and regulatory progress could significantly boost Tesla's software revenue streams and solidify its global leadership in autonomous driving.",
