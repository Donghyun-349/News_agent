This trend reflects ongoing structural headwinds such as economic deceleration and the lingering debt issues of real estate developers, which continue to burden the sector. Despite some relief in the used home segment, the broader property sector's recovery remains constrained, with future government stimulus poised to be a critical determinant of market direction.",
